# AMD FEMFX Plugin

**AMD Finite Element Material** is an Unreal Engine plugin based on the `AMD FEMFX` multi-threaded CPU library. The FEMFX library utilizes the finite element method to realistically simulate deformation of objects with different material properties.
For more information about the FEMFX library, please visit: [FEMFX Page](https://github.com/GPUOpen-Effects/FEMFX)


### Getting Started:
Dpwnload `AMD-FEM.zip` from the [releases](https://github.com/Solessfir/AMD-FEM/releases) and extract it into your project's `Plugins` folder.
	
The editor built based on the above instructions will have the FEM plugin enabled. For more information on creating and importing models into Unreal for real-time FEM simulation, please refer to [FEMFX Page](https://github.com/GPUOpen-Effects/FEMFX)
